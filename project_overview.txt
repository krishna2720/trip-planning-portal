🧭 PROJECT OVERVIEW – ExploreWorld (Accessible Travel Website)
👤 Developer:

Krishna Agarwal — B.Tech (CSE), Jaypee Institute of Information Technology

🎯 Project Goal:

To build an accessible, responsive, and user-friendly Travel Booking Website using HTML5 + CSS3,
that follows semantic web design and ARIA accessibility standards to make it usable for all types of users — including screen readers and visually impaired users.

💎 Unique Highlight — Accessibility (ARIA Integration):

This is the core highlight of the project.
Unlike normal static sites, this one uses ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes and semantic roles to improve screen reader compatibility and structure clarity.

🧩 Examples of ARIA & Role usage:
Element	Role / ARIA Attribute	Purpose
<header>	role="banner"	Identifies main site header for assistive tech
<nav>	role="navigation" aria-label="main navigation"	Tells screen readers this is a navigation section
<section id="home">	role="region" aria-label="home section"	Helps navigate between website regions
<section id="packages">	role="region" aria-label="packages section"	Defines the travel packages area
<section id="testimonials">	role="region" aria-label="testimonials section"	Announces user reviews section
<section id="booking">	role="form" aria-label="booking section"	Marks the main booking form area
<form>	aria-label="booking-form"	Describes the purpose of the form
Buttons	aria-label="book europe explorer package"	Makes buttons clear for screen readers
<iframe>	title="ExploreWorld Office Location"	Gives descriptive title to embedded map

🟢 These ensure that visually impaired users using screen readers (like NVDA or VoiceOver)
can understand the structure, navigate easily, and interact with content meaningfully.
